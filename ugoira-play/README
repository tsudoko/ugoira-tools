DISCLAIMER: This software is extremely poorly designed. Expect segfaults and
            memory leaks.

ugoira-player is a player for Pixiv's ugoira (moving picture) animations.
To play something, you need a zip with the frames and the frame metadata.
Frame metadata is stored in the ugokuIllustData JS object on the page, it will
get extracted automatically if you use ugoira-dl.

Frame metadata needs to have the same name as the zip with the frames, but with
the "json" extension instead of "zip".

Example:

  ./ugoira.zip
  ./ugoira.json

  Contents of ugoira.json:

  {
      "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
      "frames": [
          {
              "delay": 400,
              "file": "000000.jpg"
          },
          {
              "delay": 150,
              "file": "000001.jpg"
          },
          ...
      ],
      "src": "http://i1.pixiv.net/img-zip-ugoira/img/..."
  }

Currently only the "frames" array is used. If frame data isn't found, frames are
played with 1s duration each.
